# Exacta-Picker
This is a web app that uses Bayesian Statistics to pick the best exacta box selection for a horse race based upon Morning Line Odds and Tote Board Odds just before the race starts.
This web app is NOT to be used to gamble, it was a project I did purely for fun to teach myself code.  The user accepts all responsibility for the use of this code other than the intended use for entertainment and educational use only.  No warranty or guarantee is expressed, implied.  Use at your own risk.
